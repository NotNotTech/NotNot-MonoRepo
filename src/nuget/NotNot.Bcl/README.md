# NotNot.Bcl

a "kitchen sink" utility library.

This is used by other NotNot libraries and Jason's private projects.  
It is high quality and can be used independently, but doesn't have any documentation yet.

## NotNot.Bcl.Core

`NotNot.Bcl` is mostly a wrapper around `NotNot.Bcl.Core`.  Likely there is some refactoring between the two, but the seperation is meant to keep the core library as cross-platform as possible.

## interested?

Raise an issue if you are interested and I will prioritize it sooner.
